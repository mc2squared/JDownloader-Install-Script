# JDownloader-Install-Script
Simple bash scripts to quickly install JDownloader 2 headlessly

# Requirements
This assumes you're on a Linux distribution (more specifically something using apt if you're using the sudo script)
Beyond that, it just requires an internet connection and access to a user's home directory.
I made this for seedbox resellers/operators to easily deploy a browser-interactive GUI-based downloader for customers.
Any operators who want to use this script are more than free to, just don't claim credit as this being your work.
